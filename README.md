Better Redactor -- DEPRECATED
=============================

Better Redactor is a [Craft 2](https://docs.craftcms.com/v2/) plugin that provides a more
feature rich initial configuration rich text fields.

Better Redactor uses the same [Redactor](https://imperavi.com/redactor/)
library that Craft provides, it just provides it's own field type that has more
configuration:

* It includes the codemirror, alignment, fullscreen, and table plugins
* It provides a Redactor plugin that configures icons for all the entire
  redactor toolbar
* You can add additional JS/CSS files (plugins) to a new folder,
  `public/redactor_plugins`, which are automatically included
* You can still create and use custom redactor configurations by adding them to
  the `craft/config/redactor` folder.
